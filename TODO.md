## TODO

  - Organization script:
    - Integrate the script with Octopart so that it can also put a summary of the device into the model file.
  - Create a script to download one model from the vendors websites.

## DONE

  - Create a simple script to break down the LTspice files into individual models.
    - Make sure to create a separate log file with lines that were discarted (format "Line 123: 'Actual content of the line').
